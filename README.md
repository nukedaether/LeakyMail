# LeakyMail
A simple list of service providers that (may) be leaking your email

# How data is collected
I use a catch-all email service meaning when making accounts I can just do servicename@mydomain.com and it'll be created on the fly, one added benefit is if I remove any spam I can know where it came from based on what email address it was sent to

# Contributing
When contributing include an expansion offering explanation of why/how you know the leak came from the service provider you're claiming it did.

  <summary>Example Service</summary>
I'm confident example service leaked my email because I've not reused the email for anything else and other people have noticed a similar trend
